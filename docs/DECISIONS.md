# Decisions

## 2026-08-09

### Product identity is Locus

User-visible runtime strings, iOS bundle display/name metadata, and the native
launch transition use Locus. Existing internal package names and the bundle ID
remain unchanged in this slice to avoid an unrequested storage/provisioning
migration.

### Simulator checks use deterministic demo gateways

`DEMO_MODE=true` is the supported offline simulator path. It uses deterministic
weather, location, surroundings, and steps, and must not ask for real Bluetooth
or Motion permissions. Production gateways and in-context permission timing are
unchanged. Demo state is stored in `reality_diorama_demo.sqlite3`, separate from
the production database, so synthetic materials and steps cannot leak into a
normal launch.

### SQLite WAL uses the package API

Database startup calls `Database.setJournalMode('WAL')`. Executing the pragma
directly during sqflite `onConfigure` failed on the audited iOS simulator.

### Object visuals have one deterministic contract

Home, crafting, inventory, and codex use `ObjectVisualDescriptor` and
`DeterministicObjectRenderer`. Seeded variations use named stable-seed channels
and remain inside fixed placement silhouettes. Capture time selects a palette;
crafting preview and the created object share one seed function. New objects use
`object-v2`, while `object-v1` bypasses new detail channels to preserve existing
collectibles.

### Generated static art is now the primary renderer input

The owner explicitly approved moving beyond prototype geometry. A fixed v1
package of 42 generated sprites now supplies crafted objects, visitors, fixed
scenery, material emblems, and weather/time effects. Generation happens only at
authoring time: sources, exact prompts, crop rules, output dimensions, alpha
contract, and SHA-256 hashes are tracked. Locus never generates artwork at
runtime. Deterministic Canvas geometry remains available for construction state
and asset-load failure, preventing saved objects from becoming unreadable.

The AppIcon remains a separate review candidate outside `AppIcon.appiconset`.
Launch continues to use a solid native background rather than generated splash
art.

### Application dependencies are locked

Locus is an application rather than a reusable Dart package, so the generated
`pubspec.lock` is retained to keep local and CI package resolution reproducible
with Flutter 3.44.9.
